# PCL-RandomForest-Classification
This package explaines how to implement Random Forest algorithm for handheld based LiDAR point cloud data in urban area.

# Installation and Run
Run the `src/classification.R` file. It has the `data` file hardcoded from the `data` directory. 

The data is from: https://hri.fi/data/en_GB/dataset/helsingin-laserkeilausaineistot

Dr. Zeybek's fine work at: https://github.com/mzeybek583/PCL-RandomForest-Classification

### Note 
You need a `.laz` or `.laz` file that has RGB channels (aka, it needs to be "colorized"). You can check this by looking at the output of the `print()` method after you load a lidar point cloud file. 

### If you want to create your own colorized Lidar Point Cloud

Here's a lead on how to do this:
