# PCL-RandomForest-Classification
This package explaines how to implement Random Forest algorithm for handheld based LiDAR point cloud data in urban area.

Note that you need a `.laz` or `.laz` file of LAS v1.4 that has RGB channels (aka, it needs to be "colorized"). You can check this by looking at the output of the `print()` method after you load a lidar point cloud file. 

Here's a lead on how to do this: https://community.esri.com/t5/imagery-and-remote-sensing-blog/fun-with-colorizing-lidar-with-imagery/ba-p/884803
